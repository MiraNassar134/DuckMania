# DuckMania

In this Pac-Man inspired game, you control a duck who is trying to collect all of the coins in a maze while being chased by crocodiles. The crocodiles are constantly on the lookout for the duck and will try to catch it if it gets too close. However, the duck can turn the tables on the crocodiles by eating power-ups scattered throughout the maze. These power-ups give the duck temporary invincibility, allowing it to defeat the crocodiles and pass through them unharmed.

The duck must navigate through the maze, avoiding the crocodiles and collecting as many coins as possible. The coins are placed strategically throughout the maze and some may be hidden in harder-to-reach places. The duck must use its quick reflexes and strategic thinking to collect all of the coins and make it to the end of the level.

As the player progresses through the levels, the challenges will increase and the crocodiles will become more aggressive. With only three lives to work with, the player must be careful to avoid losing all of their lives before reaching the end of the game. Can you outsmart the crocodiles ?
